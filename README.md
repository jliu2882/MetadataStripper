# MetadataStripper
Many files contain metadata, which can contain sensitive information including gps_location.

The intent behind this program is to give users more control over their digital footprint by allowing them to see what information they are uploading to the web, before it is uplaoded to the Web.

## Future Features & More
Currently, the program is limited to only images. Upon the addition of libaries such as pdfminer and minor code refactorization, it will be able to handle all file types.

New features we are looking to integrate include:

    "Suggested Metadata" feature for the lazy, which would allow removal of the more sensitive information

    "Lying" feature for the more digitally cautious, which would allow users to rewrite information for the file
